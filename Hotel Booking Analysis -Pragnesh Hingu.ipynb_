A lot can be done with revenue management techniques when it comes to rates, like reducing the cost of a room during low Booking   days,over Booking methods to reduce the burden of cancelation rates, giving some extra facilities to the customers. But nowadays you have to apply similar restrictions to those applied by your competitive set and hotels around you, so if you are going to be stricter, costumers will prefer other hotels that are more permissive.\n","\n","Therefore it would seem that we have a complex problems and not a viable solution. However, thanks to data science and machine learning there are many things we can do to find which months were the hotel receiving a very less number of Bookings and  the number of Cancelations.\n","\n"," In the next chapters we are going to take on a public dataset of hotel bookings and apply an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand the data and use descriptive analysis
